# Exercise 4: Creating outgoing webhooks

In this exercise, you’ll learn how to create a web service and register it as an outgoing webhook in Microsoft Teams.

## Task 1: Create Microsoft Teams app

1. Open your command prompt, navigate to a directory where you want to save your work, create a new folder **learn-msteams**, and change directory into that folder.

1. Run the Yeoman Generator for Microsoft Teams by running the following command:

    ```console
    yo teams
    ```

    ![Screenshot of the Yeoman Generator for Microsoft Teams](../../Linked_Image_Files/Webhooks/03-yo-teams-01.png)

1. Yeoman will launch and ask you a series of questions. Answer the questions with the following values:

    - **What is your solution name?**: TeamsWebhooks
    - **Where do you want to place the files?**: Use the current folder
    - **Title of your Microsoft Teams App project?**: Teams Webhooks
    - **Your (company) name? (max 32 characters)**: Contoso
    - **Which manifest version would you like to use?**: (Accept the default option)
    - **Quick scaffolding**: Yes
    - **What features do you want to add to your project?**: An Outgoing Webhook
    - **The URL where you will host this solution?**: (Accept the default option)
    - **Would you like show a loading indicator when your app/tab loads?**: No
    - **Name of your outgoing webhook?**: Teams Webhooks Outgoing Webhook

    > **Note:**
    > Most of the answers to these questions can be changed after creating the project. For example, the URL where the project will be hosted isn't important at the time of creating or testing the project.

1. After answering the generator's questions, the generator will create the scaffolding for the project and then execute `npm install` that downloads all the dependencies required by the project.

1. Our web service will need one more NPM package to simplify finding data in an array. Execute the following command in the command prompt from the root folder of the project to install the library Lodash:

    ```console
    npm install lodash -S
    ```

## Task 2: Code the outgoing webhook

1. The Yeoman Generator for Microsoft Teams created a stub web service endpoint for our outgoing webhook. 

    Locate and open the file **./src/server/teamsWebhooksOutgoingWebhook/TeamsWebhooksOutgoingWebhook.ts**. It listens for HTTPS requests at the endpoint **/api/webhook**.

1. Find the `requestHander()` method in the `TeamsWebhooksOutgoingWebhook` class. The method first checks the HMAC value in the authorization header against the security token that you'll obtain when you add the webhook to a team.

1. Locate the following code:

    ```typescript
    message.text = `Echo ${incoming.text}`;
    ```

    This code simply echoes the string entered in the message back to Microsoft Teams that will be added in a reply to the message that triggered the webhook.

1. Let's update this code to add some real functionality. When a user @mentions the webhook, if they enter the name of a known planet of our solar system, it will respond with an adaptive card that displays details of the planet.

    Let's start by adding two resource files to the project.

    Create a new file **planets.json** in the **./src/server/teamsWebhooksOutgoingWebhook** folder and add the following JSON to it. This file will contain an array of planet details:

    ```json
    [

    ```

1. Next, create a new file **planetDisplayCard.json** in the **./src/server/teamsWebhooksOutgoingWebhook** folder and add the following JSON to it. This file will contain a template of the adaptive card the web service will respond with:

    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
      "type": "AdaptiveCard",
      "version": "1.0",
      "body": [
        {
          "id": "cardHeader",
          "type": "Container",
          "items": [
            {
              "id": "planetName",

              "weight": "bolder",
              "size": "medium"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "type": "Container",
          "id": "cardBody",
          "items": [
            {
              "id": "planetSummary",
              "type": "TextBlock",
              "wrap": true
            },
            {
              "id": "planetDetails",
              "type": "ColumnSet",
              "columns": [
                {
                  "type": "Column",
                  "width": "100",
                  "items": [
                    {
                      "id": "planetImage",
                      "size": "stretch",
                      "type": "Image"
                    }
                  ]
                },
                {
                  "type": "Column",
                  "width": "250",
                  "items": [
                    {
                      "type": "FactSet",
                      "facts": [
                        {
                          "id": "orderFromSun",
                          "title": "Order from the sun:"
                        },
                        {
                          "id": "planetNumSatellites",
                          "title": "Known satellites:"
                        },
                        {
                          "id": "solarOrbitYears",
                          "title": "Solar orbit (*Earth years*):"
                        },
                        {
                          "id": "solarOrbitAvgDistanceKm",
                          "title": "Average distance from the sun (*km*):"
                        }
                      ]
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            },
            {
              "id": "imageAttribution",
              "type": "TextBlock",
              "size": "medium",
              "isSubtle": true,
              "wrap": true
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "actions": [
        {
          "type": "Action.OpenUrl",
          "title": "Learn more on Wikipedia"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

1. Add the following `import` statement to the **./src/server/teamsWebhooksOutgoingWebhook/TeamsWebhooksOutgoingWebhook.ts** file, just after the existing `import` statements:

    ```typescript
    import { find, sortBy } from "lodash";
    ```

1. Add the following method to the `TeamsWebhooksOutgoingWebhook` class. The `getPlanetDetailCard()` method will load and populate the adaptive card template with details using the provided planet object:

    ```typescript
    private static getPlanetDetailCard(selectedPlanet: any): builder.Attachment {

      // load display card
      const adaptiveCardSource: any = require("./planetDisplayCard.json");

      // update planet fields in display card
      adaptiveCardSource.actions[0].url = selectedPlanet.wikiLink;
      find(adaptiveCardSource.body, { id: "cardHeader" }).items[0].text = selectedPlanet.name;
      const cardBody: any = find(adaptiveCardSource.body, { id: "cardBody" });
      find(cardBody.items, { id: "planetSummary" }).text = selectedPlanet.summary;
      find(cardBody.items, { id: "imageAttribution" }).text = "*Image attribution: " + selectedPlanet.imageAlt + "*";
      const cardDetails: any = find(cardBody.items, { id: "planetDetails" });
      cardDetails.columns[0].items[0].url = selectedPlanet.imageLink;
      find(cardDetails.columns[1].items[0].facts, { id: "orderFromSun" }).value = selectedPlanet.id;
      find(cardDetails.columns[1].items[0].facts, { id: "planetNumSatellites" }).value = `${selectedPlanet.numSatellites}`;
      find(cardDetails.columns[1].items[0].facts, { id: "solarOrbitYears" }).value = `${selectedPlanet.solarOrbitYears}`;
      find(cardDetails.columns[1].items[0].facts, { id: "solarOrbitAvgDistanceKm" }).value = `${Number(selectedPlanet.solarOrbitAvgDistanceKm).toLocaleString()}`;

      // return the adaptive card
      return builder.CardFactory.adaptiveCard(adaptiveCardSource);
    }
    ```

1. Next, add the following method to the `TeamsWebhooksOutgoingWebhook` class. 
    
    The `processAuthenticatedRequest()` method takes the incoming text uses it to find a planet in the **planets.json** file. If it finds one, it calls the `getPlanetDetailCard()` method to get an adaptive card and returns it as an `Activity` that will be sent back to Microsoft Teams. If a planet isn't found, it just echoes the text back in a reply to the request:

    ```typescript
    private static processAuthenticatedRequest(incomingText: string): Partial<builder.Activity> {
      const message: Partial<builder.Activity> = {
        type: builder.ActivityTypes.Message
      };

      // load planets
      const planets: any = require("./planets.json");
      // get the selected planet
      const selectedPlanet: any = planets.filter((planet) => (planet.name as string).trim().toLowerCase() === incomingText.trim().toLowerCase());

      if (!selectedPlanet || !selectedPlanet.length) {
        message.text = `Echo ${incomingText}`;
      } else {
        const adaptiveCard = TeamsWebhooksOutgoingWebhook.getPlanetDetailCard(selectedPlanet[0]);
        message.type = "result";
        message.attachmentLayout = "list";
        message.attachments = [adaptiveCard];
      }

      return message;
    }
    ```

1. Add the following `scrubMessage()` method to the `TeamsWebhooksOutgoingWebhook` class. A user must @mention an outgoing webhook to send a message to it. This method will remove the `<at></at>` text and any spaces to extract the planet name:

    ```typescript
    private static scrubMessage(incomingText: string): string {
      const cleanMessage = incomingText
                            .slice(incomingText.lastIndexOf(">")+1, incomingText.length)
                            .replace("&nbsp;", "");
      return cleanMessage;
    }
    ```

1. Finally, update the `requestHandler()` method:

    - Locate the following code and change the `message` declaration from a `const` to `let` as you'll change this value.

        ```typescript
        const message: Partial<builder.Activity> = {
          type: builder.ActivityTypes.Message
        };
        ```

    - Locate and replace the following code:

        ```typescript
        message.text = `Echo ${incoming.text}`;
        ```

      with the following code:

        ```typescript
        const scrubbedText = TeamsWebhooksOutgoingWebhook.scrubMessage(incoming.text);
        message = TeamsWebhooksOutgoingWebhook.processAuthenticatedRequest(scrubbedText);
        ```

## Task 3: Test the outgoing webhook

1. From the command line, navigate to the root folder for the project and execute the following command:

    ```console
    gulp serve
    ```

1. Next, open a new console window and execute the following command:

    ```console
    ngrok http 3007
    ```

1. This command will create dynamic HTTP and HTTPS URLs with unique subdomains that will redirect to your local web server. Make a note of the dynamic HTTPS URL because you'll need it later.

    ![Screenshot of the console with ngrok URL](../../Linked_Image_Files/Webhooks/03-ngrok-01.png)

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Be careful to not stop and restart ngrok. Each time you start ngrok, it will create a new unique URL. This will require you to reconfigure your webhooks each time you restart it.
    >
    > However, you can restart the web server you started with **gulp serve** without impacting ngrok.

1. Now let's add the outgoing webhook to a team in Microsoft Teams. In the browser, navigate to **https://teams.microsoft.com** and sign in with the credentials of a Work and School account.

1. Once you're signed in, select a channel in a team you want to add the webhook to. From the channel's page, select the **+** in the top navigation:

    ![Screencast of the channel home page](../../Linked_Image_Files/Webhooks/03-test-02.png)

1. On the **Add a tab** dialog, select **Manage apps** in the lower right corner:

    ![Screenshot of the Add a tab dialog](../../Linked_Image_Files/Webhooks/03-test-03.png)

1. This will take you to the **Manage Channel** page. Select the **Create an outgoing webhook** in the lower right corner:

    ![Screenshot of the Manage channel page](../../Linked_Image_Files/Webhooks/03-test-04.png)

1. In the **Create an outgoing webhook** dialog, enter the following values, and select **Create**:

    - **Name**: Planet Details
    - **Callback URL**: https://{{REPLACE_NGROK_SUBDOMAIN}}.ngrok.io/api/webhook

        > **Important:**
        > Replace the `{{REPLACE_NGROK_SUBDOMAIN}}` with the value of your dynamically created Ngrok URL displayed in the console when you ran `gulp ngrok-serve`.

    - **Description**: View details about the planet entered in the message.

1. After creating the outgoing webhook, Microsoft Teams will display a security token.

    ![Screenshot of the security token](../../Linked_Image_Files/Webhooks/03-test-05.png)

    Copy this value and set the `SECURITY_TOKEN` property in the **./.env** file in the project.

1. Stop the project's local web server by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> and restart it by executing the following command:

    ```console
    gulp serve
    ```

    > **CAUTION:**
    > Be careful to only stop the web server. Don't stop the ngrok process. If you do, you'll need to update the outgoing webhook registration with a new URL after restarting ngrok.

1. Now you can test the webhook. Go to a channel's **Conversation** tab within the team and enter the message **@Planet Details Venus**. Notice that as you're typing the message, Microsoft Teams detects the name of the webhook:

    ![Screenshot of the Planet Details message](../../Linked_Image_Files/Webhooks/03-test-06.png)

1. A few seconds after submitting the message, you'll see a reply to your message appear that contains the customized adaptive card with details about the planet:

    ![Screenshot of the Planet Details response](../../Linked_Image_Files/Webhooks/03-test-07.png)

1. You've successfully tested your outgoing webhook! Stop the local web server by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> in the command prompt.

## Summary

In this exercise, you learned how to create a web service and register it as an outgoing webhook in Microsoft Teams.
