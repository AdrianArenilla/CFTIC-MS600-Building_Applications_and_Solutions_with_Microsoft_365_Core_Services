# Student lab manual 04

## Lab scenario

You are a developer working for an organization that is using Microsoft Teams as the primary collaboration platform. You want to gain an understanding of the Microsoft Teams developer framework to determine if building a custom app on the Microsoft Teams platform is right for you, and if so you want to choose the right extensibility points and distribution model to make your app successful. 

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Create and use task modules.

- Create incoming and outgoing webhooks.

- Implement custom Teams tabs.

- Create messaging extensions.

- Create conversational bots.

- Use Microsoft Graph to work with Teams

- Implement single sign-on (SSO) authentication for tabs and bots


## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure user interface (UI) changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and lab steps to not match up.

The Microsoft Worldwide Learning team updates this training course as soon as the community brings needed changes to our attention. However, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content is updated. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes and work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Lab Setup

### Sign in to the lab virtual machine

Sign in to the Windows 10 virtual machine using credentials.

**Note**:
Lab virtual machine sign-in instructions will be provided to students by the instructor.

### Review installed applications

Observe the taskbar located at the bottom of your Windows 10 desktop. The taskbar contains the icons for the applications you will use in this lab:

- Microsoft Edge

- File Explorer

- Visual Studio Code

- Microsoft Teams

### Development tools

Developing Microsoft Teams apps requires a Microsoft 365 tenant, Microsoft Teams configured for development, and the necessary tools installed on your workstation.

Microsoft Teams must be configured to enable custom apps and allow custom apps to be uploaded to your tenant to build custom apps for Microsoft Teams. Follow the instructions at [Microsoft Teams: Prepare your Microsoft 365 tenant](/microsoftteams/platform/get-started/get-started-tenant).

The exercises in this module assume you have the following tools installed on your developer workstation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In most cases, installing the latest version of the following tools is the best option. The versions listed here were used when this module was published and last tested.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - v12.\* (or higher)
